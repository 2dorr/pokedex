 ### Submitting

  To submit your finished project, share with us a link to a GitHub repository containing its code. Along with instructions on how to run the app, include answers to the following:

- What part of building the project was the most difficult? Why?
- If you had to filter the list of Pokemons by its  `type` how would you have implemented it?


### Instructions
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- page loaded on `http://localhost:5173/`

### Answers
- most difficult part: going through the pokemon API, since there wasn't an exact endpoint on getting pokemons by name(or at least i didn't find it)
- I listed the pokemons by their type, it seemed more appropriate, although i left a coment in `src/service/pokenode.ts`  
- couldn't add UTs, i would have rolled over by a bit
